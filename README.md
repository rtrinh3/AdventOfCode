These are my solutions to https://adventofcode.com/ .

I usually run these in Visual Studio, but you should be able to run them from the command line. Each year has its own project and its own executable. 
The executable takes 2 arguments: the first is the day, the second can be either the literal input or the name of the file containing the input.

For example:
```
Aoc2023.exe 01 "oneightwo"
Aoc2023.exe 24 "day24-input.txt"
```

This also contains tests based on the examples and on my inputs. The input files are not included in this repository.
